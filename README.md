## Mission Statement

## Dataset

The dataset used for the analysis was retrieved from [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/discussion/371426) 

The dataset contains personal fitness tracking data from thirty Fitbit users. The data includes personal tracker-data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. 
Furthermore, it includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate. The data was collected from 12.4.2016 to 12.5.2016.

The dataset is comprised of 18 .csv files.

## Limitations of the data

Some limitations that are important to consider:

FitBit data does not include information about gender and age. Since Bellabeat is targeting mainly women with their products, this is an important factor to keep in mind when making recommendations based on this data.

The dataset may exhibit some bias since all participants were volunteers, they were not randomly selected from a wide population of FitBit users. Thus, the entire population of FitBit users might not be reflected in this sample.

The data was collected in 2016, which means it is not very current. The trends from 2016 might not be applicable to 2023.
